<h1>Usability</h1>


<p>
    The page was made using a 960px grid so that it doens't look too wide of a page for the user to read.
    Since the page is mainly vertical there was no reason to have text really long horizontally.
    The page was then made responsive so that if a person was to however have a smaller screen it would still be easy
    for them to see the page without any horizontal scrolling.

    One very impressive thing that was added to the site was the footer. This is normally very impossible to do with css.
    This type of footer is called a sticky footer. This is where the footer will move to the bottom of the page if there is room.
    This was done using some fancy css properties. A user would not like to see blank spaces left for the rest of the page.
    By doing this it allow the page to have a fuller look even while it is lacking content.

    This sites was design to have a very simple on the eyes approach.
    There was no excessive contrast used on the page.
    Instead of using contrast the page created importance by using difference in colors.
    Things such as the header are in different color to symbolize that is is of a different class compared to the regular paragraph.
    The paragraphs on the page were all shrunk in width so that it doens't have too much text that has to be read
